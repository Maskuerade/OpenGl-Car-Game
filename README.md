# Simple Car Project using OpenGL and Basic Graphics

## Project Overview
This project is a simple car simulation built using **C++** and **OpenGL**. It demonstrates basic graphics principles such as object movement, collision detection, and user interaction using the OpenGL library. The car moves in a simulated environment, interacting with other objects and responding to basic controls.

## Files and Structure

- `.idea/` - Configuration files for project settings (specific to IDE, such as JetBrains).
- `cmake-build-debug/` - Build directory for CMake-generated build files.
- `glm-master/` - External library directory for handling matrix operations in OpenGL.
- `.gitattributes` - Configuration file for Git attributes.
- `camera_simpleCollision_Text` - C++ source file implementing simple collision detection using camera and object movements.
- `CMakeLists.txt` - CMake configuration file to manage project build dependencies and compilation.
- `helixList` - C++ source file managing additional 3D objects or paths such as a helix in the scene.
- `main` - Main C++ source file that initializes the OpenGL context and manages the overall game logic.
- `NeedForSpeed` - C++ source file implementing the car's physics and movement, likely inspired by racing games.
- `README` - Markdown file (likely this one) explaining the project.
- `spaceship` - C++ source file potentially handling other 3D objects or models, such as spaceships, which may serve as obstacles or part of the environment.
- `spaceTravel` - C++ source file, possibly handling more advanced graphical elements such as space background or additional environmental effects.

## Features
1. **Car Movement**: The core of the project revolves around controlling a car, including acceleration and steering.
2. **Collision Detection**: Simple collision mechanics are implemented to detect and respond to objects in the environment.
3. **Graphics Rendering**: Using OpenGL to render 3D models (e.g., cars, obstacles) with basic textures and colors.
4. **Camera and Object Interaction**: The camera follows the car and adjusts based on its movement, providing a dynamic view of the simulation.
5. **Environmental Elements**: Possible additional elements such as spaceships and environmental objects are rendered alongside the car.

## Dependencies
- **C++**: Core programming language used for the project.
- **OpenGL**: Library used for rendering graphics.
- **GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)**: A mathematics library for handling vector and matrix operations, crucial for handling 3D transformations and camera angles.

## How to Build and Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**: Ensure that you have installed the necessary development packages for OpenGL and GLM.

3. **Build using CMake**:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

## How to Use

- Use the **arrow keys** or other specified controls to move the car.
- The camera follows the car as it moves through the environment.
- Collisions with obstacles are handled to simulate a basic driving experience.
  
## Future Improvements

- Add advanced textures and lighting effects.
- Improve the collision detection algorithm.
- Implement a more complex physics engine for better car handling.
- Add more obstacles and game elements, such as racing tracks and checkpoints.
